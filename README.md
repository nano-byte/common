## Building

The source code is in [`src/`](src/), a project for API documentation is in [`doc/`](doc/) and generated build artifacts are placed in `artifacts/`.

You need [Visual Studio 2019](https://www.visualstudio.com/downloads/) to perform a full build of this project.  
You can build the cross-platform components on Linux using just the [.NET Core SDK 3.1+](https://www.microsoft.com/net/download). Additionally installing [Mono 6.4+](https://www.mono-project.com/download/stable/) allows more components to be built. The build scripts will automatically adjust accordingly.

Run `.\build.ps1` on Windows or `./build.sh` on Linux. These scripts take a version number as an input argument. The source code itself contains only contains dummy version numbers. The actual version is picked by continuous integration using [GitVersion](http://gitversion.readthedocs.io/).
